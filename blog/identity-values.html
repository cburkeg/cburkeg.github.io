          I recently spent some time traveling around South East Asia and wanted
          to visit Cambodia, particularly to see Angkor Wat. This would mean
          that I would have to pay the Cambodian government for a visa and for
          entry into Angkor Wat itself. I am certainly no expert on Cambodian
          politics, but I understand that Cambodia is a flawed democracy at best
          and is effectively ruled by a junta following a coup in the 90's, so I
          initially had some misgivings about this trip.
        </p>
        <p>
          On one hand, I would be effectively enabling the current government
          (who go against my democratic values) by giving them money and would
          be fueling corruption. On the other hand, my tourism dollars could
          help a developing nation that is reeling from a genocide within living
          memory and is suffering under the long shadow of colonialism. I
          eventually decided that the pros of visiting the country outweighed
          the cons, particularly because the culture and history of the country
          will long outlast the contemporary government of today. However, I
          think these issues do need to be decided on a case by case basis, and
          would exclude me from visiting some countries (e.g. North Korea).

          I grew up in a pakeha househould where reading and learning was
          strongly encouraged. My mum was a teacher with lots of supplies for us
          kids, while dad had a large collection of books verging on a small
          library. Both mum and dad had a strong interest in reading that was
          passed on to me and my siblings at an early age. Both of my parents
          were very supportive academically and strongly valued education. They
          encouraged me to succeed at school and were very supportive. I think
          my parents are responsible for a lot of my characteristics including
          my interest in scholarship, reading, and learning.

          Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your
          learning journey.
        </h3>
        <p>I think my main strengths are:</p>
        <p>
          <b>Fast learner:</b> I am good at taking on new information and
          picking up new skills. This will help me get to grips with material as
          it is introduced.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Persistent:</b> I am good at solving problems the over long term. I
          am not easily discouraged and wonâ€™t give up when confronted with
          difficult problems.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Background in technical education:</b> I have several post-graduate
          degrees and five years of professional experience to draw from.
          Reflecting on my experience with learning in the past will help me
          develop better skills and strategies to make the most of Dev Academy.

          I have a tendency to be driven by negative motivators rather than
          positive motivators (e.g. I may be more motivated to finish an
          assignment by the fear of failure rather than a desire to succeed).
          Although this approach can be effective at achieving good outcomes, it
          obviously isn't the healthiest method and leads to burnout/isn't
          sustainable. Suffering from negative motivation can potentially
          restrict the full potential of possible learning offered by a course.

          Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with
          others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you

          what other strategies you would try now and why.

          I previously had some friction when working on group project with
          other people while studying remotely for my qualification as a patent
          attorney. We were assigned to answer a question posed to our group,
          but several people within the group (including myself) had different
          opinions on what our answer should be. Unfortunately there were too
          many people placed together in our group for us to have a simple
          discussion about the merits of different ideas. The group also didn't
          have any hierarchy or a facilitator to help mediate discussion. The
          virtual format of the course also made it difficult to freely exchange
          and discuss proposed answers with one another.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because there wasn't any way to easily discuss the pros and cons of
          different answers due to lack of structure within the group, I
          resolved my part in the conflict by not advocating for my own answer.
          I thought that compromising in this instance was better for group
          unity overall as this group assignment wasn't particularly
          significant. I still think this was a good decision in retrospect
          given the constraints of the format and the inconsequence of outcome,
          although it was disappointing that the solution was essentially to
          avoid any discussion altogether. However, if the same conflict took
          place in a context that was more consequential, then in the future I
          would make sure that my concerns were raised and discussed before we
          took part in shared decision-making.
