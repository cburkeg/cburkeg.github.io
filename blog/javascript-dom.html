          What's an analogy that describes JavaScript and its relationship to
          HTML and CSS?
        </h3>
        <p>
          In my mind, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are similar to the different
          components of a socket wrench (or other modular tool). The tool itself
          and size/details of the socket represents the HTML of a website. This
          is the actual 'content' of the tool and is the part that is actually
          used at the end of the day. Similarly, the interface and ergonomics of
          the tool represent the CSS of the website. These aspects change the
          look and feel of the tool - and ultimately determine how we access and
          use the tool - without changing the fundamental functionality of the
          tool.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, the modularity of the socket represents JavaScript. This is
          the component that allows us to dynamically change the tool to suit
          changing conditions, meaning that tool can be adjusted to solve other
          problems. This is the difference between a modular socket wrench and a
          fixed tool, such as a hammer - which in this analogy is equivalent to
          a basic website that only uses HTML and CSS. Note that there are some
          obvious limitations to this analogy - not least of which is that
          JavaScript can be used to change CSS!

        <h3>
          Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday
          life
        </h3>

        <p>
          In programming, 'flow control' refers to the order that the computer
          parses and executes instructions. The flow control typically reads as
          it is written by the author (i.e. from top to bottom), but there are
          special instances which deliberate direct the program flow in specific
          ways or directions.
        </p>
        <p>
          For instance, flow control can be altered by loops. These are small
          sets of instructions that repeat (or 'loop' araound) until a condition
          is satisfied. For example, a for loop can repeat a certain number of
          times (either predefined or variable). Other loops (such as while
          loops) can continue looping while a condition is satisfied, or can
          continue looping until a condition has satisfied.
        </p>
        <p>
          One example of flow control would be a set of meticulous instructions
          for cooking pancakes. In pseudocode, this could look like:
        </p>
        <code
          >heat pan <br />
          prepare batter <br />
          while (there is enough batter for at least one pancake):<br />
          spoon out pancake <br />
          flip pancakes <br />
          remove pancakes from pan</code
        >
        <p>
          This program will first flow from top to bottom, starting with heating
          the pan, and will continue to the first line of the while loop. If
          there is enough batter for at least one pancake, then a pancake will
          be spooned out. However, the flow will then backtrack to the condition
          of the while loop and a check will be made to see if the condition is
          true or false. If the condition is true (i.e. there is more batter for
          more pancakes), then the flow will loop between the first and last
          line of the while loop until there is insufficient batter for another
          pancake.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with
          it.
        </h3>
        <p>
          My understanding of the DOM is that at its base level, it is both a
          way of formatting and organising the objects within an HTML page, and
          a set of functions (methods) and values (attributes) associated with
          HTML elements. Web page contains lots of different HTML elements in
          single page, which interact with CSS styling and JavaScript. The DOM
          models these elements in a tree format, with child elements branching
          off from parent elements (e.g. paragraphs that are nested within div
          tags.) This establishes a hierarchy for different elements to inherit
          characteristics from parents. At the highest level, the HTML document
          itself is an object.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to organising HTML elements into a hierarchy, the DOM also
          provides a set of tools (i.e. methods and attributes) that allow us to
          interact with the HTML elements of hte page. For example, we can use a
          method provided by the DOM to find an HTML element by its ID (using
          document.findElementByID), or to find multiple elements by their class
          (document.findElementsByClass). We can then alter the attributes of
          these elements to dynamically adjust the web page. For instance, the
          value of the .innerHTML property of these elements determines their
          HTML content.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, if we wanted to change the text within a paragraph, we
          could first find that paragraph by its ID, and then change its
          innerHTML property to whatever was desired.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.
        </h3>
        <p>
          Arrays store data in an ordered list of items. The items in this list
          are indexed by their position within in the list. Array[0] refers to
          the first element within the array, while array[1] refers to the
          second, up to array[n-1] (where n is the length of the array). If you
          want to access data from an array, you need to know the position of
          the data within the array to use as an index. In comparison, an object
          represents a 'thing' that has 'properties'. Each property has a key
          (which acts as an index for the property) and a value. For example, a
          kitchen's inventory could be represented as an object in JavaScript by
          recording the different ingredients and their stock as pairs of keys
          and values. The stock for a given item could be retrieved using the
          item itself (i.e. the key) as an index, rather than a numerical
          position on the list.
        </p>
        <h3>Explain what functions are and why they are helpful.</h3>
        <p>
          Functions are repeatable blocks of code that are bound to a shorthand
          variable which can then be called later in a program. Functions can
          optionally take input variables, but these aren't always necessary.
          Functions can serve multiple purposes and can be used to modify and
          create data. For example, functions can return a value or modify the
          value of an existing variable. Functions can also have other utilities
          such as displaying things on the screen, facilitating communication
          between programs, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          Functions are helpful for multiple reasons. Firstly, using functions
          can save you lots of time. Instead of needing to repeat the same code
          every time you need to do something, you can simply define a function
          once and then call that function as needed. Functions can also be
          modular and can integrate with other functions if needed. Functions
          are also flexible and can be changed or adjusted at a later date. If
          the body of function changed (e.g. if values of variables are
          changed), then these changes propagate throughout the code
          automatically.
