        <h3>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>
        <p>
          I would generally define emotional intelligence (or 'emotional
          quotient'/EQ) as a person's ability to recognise, understand, and
          manage emotions in themself and in other people. People with a high EQ
          are able to easily pick up on how others are feeling, can empathise
          with them and can understand their situation. They have good
          interpersonal skills, can communicate clearly and easily with other
          people, and can resolve conflicts that may arise.
        </p>
        <p>
          Similarly, people with a high EQ are acutely aware of how they
          themselves are feeling and can recognise when emotions arise within
          themself. A person with a high EQ is able to monitor and be aware of
          their own emotions from a distance, rather than being lost within the
          emotion itself. This emotional distance helps the person manage and
          regulate their own emotions. People with a high EQ are more inclined
          towards moderation and equanimity rather than emotional outbursts or
          extremes.
        </p>
        <h3>How is EQ different to IQ?</h3>
        <p>
          A perosn's IQ is an abstract measure of their cognitive skill or
          overall intelligence (although I personally think one needs to be
          careful when trying to infer very much from a person's IQ - I feel
          these tests more a measure of how good people are at finding/matching
          patterns, or passing IQ tests themselves, rather than 'intelligence'
          in a meaningful sense.) A person's IQ supposedly represents a person's
          ability to solve problems, match patterns, identify relationships, and
          solve logical challenges. In comparison, a person's EQ is a different
          skillset and is independent of their IQ. A person can have a high IQ
          and may be able to solve complex problems, but they can simultaneously
          have a low EQ. For example, they may be unable to handle their own
          emotions (e.g. flying into rages rather than being measured and
          patient), incapable of empathising with others (e.g. being brusque,
          rude, insensitive), unable to develop friendships, etc.
        </p>
        <h3>Why is EQ important?</h3>
        <p>
          Emotional intelligence is important as it helps us understand and
          manage our relationship with others and with ourselves. Being
          emotionally intelligent lets us build self-awareness and self-control,
          regulate our emotions, gives us more equanimity, and more ability to
          deal with the vicissitudes of life. People who are emotionally
          intelligent are happier overall and better at stress management.
          Having a high emotional intelligence gives self confidence and helps
          with empathy and connecting with others better. This helps with
          communication and teamwork and improves leadership.
