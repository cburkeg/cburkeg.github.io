        <h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
        <p>
          My long term goal is a career working in tech. I would like to
          eventually work in a role that is fully remote or allows me to
          travel/live overseas, and ideally has a four-day work week. I am not
          sure of the exact role that I would like to take on as I know there
          are lots of different specialisations within tech overall, and there
          may be niche roles that I'm completely unaware of but would be very
          well suited for!
        </p>
        <h3>
          A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
          learning
        </h3>
        <p>
          I have a lot of experience with learning as I have studied several
          topics to a high level before (I have a PhD in Physics and a Masters
          in Intellectual Property). I therefore have many of strategies and
          skills to draw from that have worked in the past. I think that I'm a
          fast learner and am also persistent. I am happy to keep on trying to
          solve problem a or understand a concept. In terms of limitations, I
          think that I can be driven by negative motivators (e.g. fear of
          failure or worry about the future) rather than desire for positive
          outcomes, which I don't think is the healthiest way to learn or study.
        </p>
        <h3>
          What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
          developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
        </h3>
        <p>
          I am primarily here to develop my technical skills, but I would like
          to develop a mindset where I am motivated more positively rather than
          negatively, if possible. I also think that everybody can always work
          on giving and receiving feedback, myself included.
        </p>

        <h3>
          A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
        </h3>
        <p>
          I commit that I will manage my workload by consistently and
          sustainably working through the material required, rather than
          allowing work to pile up and accummulate. I will regularly check in
          with my facilitator in our meetings to make sure that I am on the
          right track and am at the right stage. I will also make sure to seek
          help if I feel that I am struggling to manage the workload. In terms
          of working with others, I will listen to others to ensure safe and
          make sure they are heard and feel valued within the work environment.
        </p>

        <h3>
          A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
        </h3>
        <p>
          As above, I commit that I will seek help as soon as I think I could
          benefit from it. I will do this either in person or remotely depending
          on the circumstances (e.g. the nature of the help, who is available,
          etc).
        </p>
        <h3>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>
        <p>
          I expect the facilitation team to help me out with any technical
          problems when asked, in a reasonable timeframe. I also expect them to
          help me not only solve the problem, but to ideally understand the
          solution. The facilitation team should also be patient and should
          understand that I am here to learn.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
          committed to other things.
        </h3>
        <p>I have no conflicting schedules.</p>
