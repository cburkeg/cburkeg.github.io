        <h3>Updated learning plan - after Sprint 5</h3>
        <h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
        <p>
          I don't think my long term career goal has changed from a desire to
          work in tech. I am still not sure of the exact role that I would like
          to take on, but from what I've learned so far, I enjoy (and am better
          at) back-end programming rather than front-end work. I think my long
          term goal is to move to "hard" backend programming and software
          development.
        </p>
        <h3>
          A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
          learning
        </h3>
        <p>
          I don't think my overview of my strengths and limitations has
          significantly changed. Foundations reminded me that I sometimes
          struggle to motivate myself when working from home, but I never had
          any issues handing in any of the work on time. However, I plan to
          spend as much time at the Dev Academy office in-person as is
          reasonable to minimise these possibly less-productive days.
        </p>
        <h3>
          What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
          developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
        </h3>
        <p>
          I still want to develop a mindset where I am motivated more positively
          rather than negatively, if possible. I also want to practice pair
          programming so I can learn to give and receive feedback better. I'd
          also like to ideally feel more comfortable and at-ease when working
          with new people for hte first time.
        </p>

        <h3>
          A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
        </h3>
        <p>
          Bootcamp will not be asynchronous, so my previous commitment to
          self-motivate is somewhat unneeded. Instead, I commit to regularly be
          present when required and to make sure that I stick to my schedule. As
          before, I will regularly check in with my facilitator in our meetings
          to make sure that I am on the right track and am at the right stage. I
          will also make sure to seek help if I feel that I am struggling to
          manage the workload.
        </p>

        <h3>
          A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
        </h3>
        <p>
          This is unchanged - I again commit that I will seek help as soon as I
          think I could benefit from it. I will do this either in person or
          remotely depending on the circumstances (e.g. the nature of the help,
          who is available, etc).
        </p>
        <h3>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>
        <p>
          My previous expectations still apply (help with technical problems in
          a reasonable timeframe; help me understand the solution; be patient
          with me.) In addition, I expect the facilitation team to regularly
          provide me with code feedback to help me improve what I have already
          written. I have found out that I often do not need help with technical
          problems so far, but often wonder if there are better ways of solving
          the problem or drawbacks to my own solution. I'd like to spend more
          time exploring these aspects and to get help trying to write the best
          code possible, rather than merely writing code that compiles and
          works.

        <h3>Original learning plan</h3>
        <h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
        <p>
          My long term goal is a career working in tech. I would like to
          eventually work in a role that is fully remote or allows me to
          travel/live overseas, and ideally has a four-day work week. I am not
          sure of the exact role that I would like to take on as I know there
          are lots of different specialisations within tech overall, and there
          may be niche roles that I'm completely unaware of but would be very
          well suited for!
        </p>
        <h3>
          A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
          learning
        </h3>
        <p>
          I have a lot of experience with learning as I have studied several
          topics to a high level before (I have a PhD in Physics and a Masters
          in Intellectual Property). I therefore have many of strategies and
          skills to draw from that have worked in the past. I think that I'm a
          fast learner and am also persistent. I am happy to keep on trying to
          solve problem a or understand a concept. In terms of limitations, I
          think that I can be driven by negative motivators (e.g. fear of
          failure or worry about the future) rather than desire for positive
          outcomes, which I don't think is the healthiest way to learn or study.
        </p>
        <h3>
          What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
          developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
        </h3>
        <p>
          I am primarily here to develop my technical skills, but I would like
          to develop a mindset where I am motivated more positively rather than
          negatively, if possible. I also think that everybody can always work
          on giving and receiving feedback, myself included.
        </p>

        <h3>
          A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
        </h3>
        <p>
          I commit that I will manage my workload by consistently and
          sustainably working through the material required, rather than
          allowing work to pile up and accummulate. I will regularly check in
          with my facilitator in our meetings to make sure that I am on the
          right track and am at the right stage. I will also make sure to seek
          help if I feel that I am struggling to manage the workload. In terms
          of working with others, I will listen to others to ensure safe and
          make sure they are heard and feel valued within the work environment.
        </p>

        <h3>
          A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
        </h3>
        <p>
          As above, I commit that I will seek help as soon as I think I could
          benefit from it. I will do this either in person or remotely depending
          on the circumstances (e.g. the nature of the help, who is available,
          etc).
        </p>
        <h3>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>
        <p>
          I expect the facilitation team to help me out with any technical
          problems when asked, in a reasonable timeframe. I also expect them to
          help me not only solve the problem, but to ideally understand the
          solution. The facilitation team should also be patient and should
          understand that I am here to learn.
