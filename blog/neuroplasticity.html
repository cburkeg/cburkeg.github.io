        <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>
        <h3>
          Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits
          people
        </h3>
        <p>
          Neuroplasticity is the brain's ability to change, reorganise, and
          rewire itself. It was previously thought that a person's brain was
          only neuroplastic over a specific period in childhood, but more recent
          research has shown that the brain remains neuroplastic even throughout
          adulthood. Evidence suggests that once students are told that their
          brains (and by extension their skills and abilities) are malleable and
          can be changed - rather than being static and fixed - those students
          have a more positive attitude towards learning and challenges. They
          are less deterministic and are willing to embrace difficulty, seeing
          it as an opportunity to improve their skills rather than a test of
          some intrinsic part or reflection of their person or their value.
          Knowing that the brain is malleable and that skills can be improved
          leads to better academic and career results overall.

        <h3>
          Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity
          for your benefit
        </h3>
        <p>
          I think it will be useful to reflect on skills that I've learned in
          the past to remind myself that I can become very proficient at things
          that I was previously had no idea how to do. It's useful to remember
          that there's nothing to stop me from getting very good at programming
          and web development if I repeatedly practice, embrace challenges, and
          push myself to learn more and more difficult material.
        </p>
        <h3>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h3>
        <p>
          My takeaway from the material is the importance of practice and
          reinforcement. It is also to put information into its appropriate
          context and to move away from wrote memorisation. This leads to better
          understanding and retention of material.

          on neuroplasticity very interesting, particularly reading about the
          role of neuroplasticity in recover from serious trauma such as brain
          damage, stroke recovery, etc. I don't think these aspects of
          neuroplasticity are particularly relevant to us, because they deal
          with gross changes to brain structure/function in response to serious
          damage or health problems - but I still find this fascinating in its
          own right. It is amazing to read about how the human brain is able to
          adapt to almost unimaginable damage. If you're also interested in
          this, then you may enjoy reading about a

        <h2>Growth mindset</h2>
        <h3>Discuss what it a growth mindset is and why it is relevant</h3>
        <p>
          I understand that a growth mindset is a belief that abilities and
          aptitudes can be developed and can improve over time with training.
          Having a growth mindset means that challenges are seen as
          opportunities to improve and develop skills further, and current
          abilities are recognised as non-fixed and changeable. This outlook
          similarly means that someone's performance at some task or ability is
          not necessarily reflective of their value or personal worth - it is
          instead just a snapshot of their ability in time, separate from their
          person. In other words, having a growth mindset allows you to
          positively receive constructive criticisim and feedback so that you
          can improve, rather than defensively react to what is incorrectly
          perceived as an attack on 'you'.
        </p>
        <h3>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h3>
        <p>
          I don't think anything particularly significant changed for me
          honestly, because I already believed in the idea that our abilities
          can develop over time with repeated practice - both through personal
          first-hand experience and through watching the development of others
          (e.g. coworkers and fellow students). I think it's always good to
          remind myself of this though.
        </p>
        <h3>
          How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?
        </h3>
        <p>
          I will continue to remind myself that we can learn and evelop new
          skills, and will reflect on the skills that I've already learned in
          the past. I can remind myself there is nothing stopping me from
          getting very good at this if I repeatedly practice.
        </p>

          I was interested to read some
          <a
            href="https://austinlearningsolutions.com/images/stories/growth-mindset/Dweck_Growth_Mindsets.pdf"
            >reflections on growth mindset</a
          >
          by the author (Carol Dwerck) of the original paper popularising the
          growth mindset, written some time after her initial work. She
          emphasies that people, in reality, are a mixture of both fixed
          mindsets and growth mindsets. The author notes that it is easy to
          think that we can adopt a growth mindset once the benefits are shown
          to us, and it is easy to understand the logic of a growth mindset on
          an intellectual level, but it is harder to actually put into practice.
          We must watch ourselves internally to see how we actually respond to
          situations and challenges, and to note when we might be responding
          from a fixed mindset perspective (which, by the bye, also ties in with
          mindfulness.)
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, when we are facing challenges, we should look inwardly
          and ask ourselves if any discomfort or anxiety arises. We can also
          look at others who are better than us at things we think are important
          - do we feel jealousy (as per a fixed mindset), or do we feel inspired
          (as per a growth mindset)? Dweck notes that we should be realistic and
          honest with ourselves about ourselves, or there is a danger of falling
          into 'false growth mindset'.
        </p>
        <p>
          The article also discusses the potential danger of growth mindsets
          being used to make students feel better without actually improving
          their academic performance - in other words, instead of closing actual
          achievement gaps, there is a danger of hiding achievement gaps by
          reassuring students that everyone is equal. I think this is a good
          reminder that we need to use these tools at our disposal to actually
          achieve results and learn material, rather than simply feeling good
          about ourselves (which, of course, is important too).
        </p>
        <h3>
          Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence
          your learning plan and strategy
        </h3>
        <p>
          I already believe in a growth mindset on some level before, as I have
          seen my own abilties improve with practice and time, and the ability
          of others too - so on some lvel, my learning strategy is already
          shaped by these ideas. However, I will try identifying actual fixed
          mindet thinking versus growth mindset thinking through the use of
          mindfulness, as discussed above in relation to Carol Dweck's
          reflections. For example, when I'm studying or programming, does
          apprehension or a desire to avoid an unpleasant feeling arise, and if
          so, is this coming from a fixed mindset frame of reference? This
          strategy ties in with mindfulness in learning and in life too.
