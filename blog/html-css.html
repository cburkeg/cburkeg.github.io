        <h3>Box model</h3>

        <p>
          CSS uses a 'box model' to display HTML elements on screen. Each HTML
          element is surrounded by a box that is drawn around the element and
          separates the content itself (contained within the box) from the boxes
          of other elements. Each box has an associated margin, border, and
          padding. These variables are used to buffer and separate the boxed
          elements from one another, and also determine the position of content
          with respect to its own box. The figure below shows the margin,
          border, and padding of an example box.
        </p>
        <div class="content">
          <img
            class="columnimage"
            src="../styles/margindiagram.png"
            alt="Diagram showing margin, border, and padding"
          />
        </div>
        <h3>Margin</h3>
        <p>
          The <b>margin</b> is the area (shown in orange above) that surrounds
          the box associated with the example HTML element. The size of the
          margin can be independently set (in absolute units or in relative
          units) for each side of the box. A box's margin is the distance
          between the border of the box and the margins of other boxes belonging
          to other HTML elements. In other words, if two elements are displayed
          side by side on a page, then the boxes surrounding those elements are
          separated by their combined margins. The margin is also the distance
          between the boxes of outer-most elements and the edge of the page. The
          margin does not affect the spacing of the content itself relative to
          the box's border.
        </p>

        <h3>Border</h3>
        <p>
          The <b>border</b> (shown in black in the figure above) is the outer
          portion of the box that surrounds the padding and content. The border
          separates the content from the remainder of the page and can be hidden
          or shown. There are many visual aspects of the border that can be
          changed including the border's style (e.g. solid or dashed) and its
          colour. The width of the border can also be varied. The border on each
          side of the box can be customised independently of the other sides.
        </p>

        <h3>Padding</h3>
        <p>
          The <b>padding</b> (shown in blue in the figure above) is the area
          between the content itself and the internal border of the box. The
          padding can be also measured in absolute or relative units and, like
          the margin, can be independently set for the different sides of the
          box. The combined size of the padding and the content itself
          determines the dimensions of the box and its border.
        </p>

        <h3>
          How can I learn more about an element's margin, border, and padding?
        </h3>
        <p>
          It can be difficult to determine whether the spacing of a given
          element is due to the element's margin or padding, as both the margin
          and padding are transparent. It can even be difficult to determine
          <i>which</i> margin or padding is responsible for the spacing between
          adjacent elements. Dev tools can be very helpful in these situations
          as they colour-code the margin and padding of a selected element using
          the above scheme. The Styles tab can also tell you where the values
          for the margin, border, and padding are being inherited from.
