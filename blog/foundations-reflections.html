          What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego
          due to the core learning?
        </h3>
        <p>
          I don't think I've learned anything about myself that was entirely and
          categorically new, but I have got to know certain aspects of myself
          better, particularly through mindfulness. In particular, I reminded
          myself that I can struggle to work very productively when at home;
          although I can have productive days when the setting is right, a lot
          of the time a change of scene to get out of the house is very
          important. I have also found that it is still difficult to force
          myself to spend very long writing these blog posts and other parts of
          the core work (particularly writing reflections). I think this is
          because I still have some residual burn-out from my previous work.
          However, I'm etting better at managing this. Mindfulness is helpful to
          notice when my aversion to this work does arise, and to coach myself
          through to the other side.
        </p>

        <h3>
          What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning
          and programming?
        </h3>

        <p>
          I'm not really sure if I can fully answer this honestly, because I
          feel like a lot of the core work has been quite separate from
          programming. What I would say is that although the coding we've done
          to date has been isolated and solo, working as a programmer is
          ultimately a job spent working with other people and is a human
          activity. We will need to work alongside teammates, so we need to be
          aware of both them and their feelings in addition to ourselves and our
          own feelings in order to work collaborately and productively. If we
          lack these core human skills, then we won't want to be somebody that
          others also want to work with. You can be technically brilliant but if
          you're lacking in empathy and self-awareness, then you won't work well
          with others and won't be good at achieving outcomes overall.
        </p>

        <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
        <p>
          As mentioned above, I was quite strongly surprised at my reluctance to
          write blogs and reflections as part of our core work, even though this
          kind of writing should be easy for me given my professional
          experience. I was particularly surprised that I am still overcoming
          this reluctance.
        </p>

        <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
        <p>
          My main challenge was to motivate myself to start writing about my
          blog and reflect on my experiences, mainly. If I'm being honest with
          myself, the reflections felt like a chore and I had to force myself to
          begin each time. Don't get me wrong - this doesn't mean that I think I
          don't get any benefit from the reflections or blogs, but I still found
          this work significantly harder than the technical work. Learning about
          the concepts was fun, and I enjoyed putting them into practice (e.g.
          regular meditation), but the writing specifically difficult for me to
          face.
        </p>

        <h3>
          Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
          focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
        </h3>
        <p>
          I think a significant amount of time is focused on core skills because
          these are the most important skills in our entire careers. While
          technical ability is obviously important, companies will
          preferentially hire people with good core human skills over technical
          skill. Core skills are therefore very important in the tech industry,
          even if they don't relate to coding per se.
        </p>

        <h3>
          Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste
          of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming
          instead? Justify your answer.
        </h3>
        <p>
          I don't think this has been a waste of time because as above, the
          skills we've been developing are very important over the course of our
          careers. However, I thinking practicing and truly developing these
          skills is very different to practicing coding. I feel as though the
          core work that we've done to date is more of an introduction to make
          sure that we are aware of conceptual skills and have the tools needed
          to study those skills outselves. Learning those skills with the
          provided tools is largely up to us and is to be done in our own time,
          over a long timeframe. Realsitically speaking, we are not going to
          revolutionise our outlook as people or how we treat others after
          writing a 30 minute blog post - but perhaps we can sow the seeds that,
          with sufficient nurturing over a longer time frame, will ultimately
          help us in workplace and in life in general.
