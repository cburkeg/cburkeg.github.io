        <h3>A space too far</h3>
        <p>
          I wanted to format my
          <a href="/blog/te-whare-tapa-wha.html">wellness plan</a> content into
          a table, and thought this would be a good opportunity to reinforce
          what I had learned from Sprint 2 by implement padding within the cells
          and margins within tables. However, I initially couldn't get the table
          padding and margins to work properly. The console wasn't showing any
          errors when I saved my code, but the CSS wasn't working as I had
          expected. The table lacked any padding or margins at all, regardless
          of how extreme I set the CSS padding and margin values to.
        </p>
        <p>
          I closely compared my code to examples provided in HTML documentation
          but couldn't see any difference between my own code and theirs, so I
          knew the odd behaviour of the CSS was likely due to a silly mistake. I
          continued to look line by line at my CSS code and finally discovered
          that I had included a white space between the value and the units of
          the attribute (e.g. "10 em" vs "10em"). This was after a fairly
          significant amount of time spent trouble shooting, but I didn't feel
          much frustration as I was expecting the error to be due to something
          like this in the first place. I also learned that VS Code colour-codes
          units and values in CSS, which is a simple way to see if there are any
          errors similar to my own at a glance.
        </p>

        <h3>Nested functions</h3>

        <p>
          One of my solutions that I thought was particularly elegant was my
          solution to the 'Find You' problem in JS Kata 5. The problem wanted me
          to define a function that used the find() method to locate an element
          within a group of elements. The find() method itself involves calling
          a separate function on each element within the group, and then
          returning the element for which the separate function returns 'true'.
          I therefore realised that I would need to find some suitable function
          to provide to the find() method, or I would need to define a function
          of my own. This was more appealing to me, but this meant that I had
          the problem of how - or more specifically where - to define the
          separate function used in the find() method.
        </p>
        <p>
          To solve this problem one way, I could define the separate function
          globally and then provide it to find() in my main function, but this
          would mean that mmy main function wouldn't be self-contained or
          modular. Based on my understanding, I wouldn't be able to export my
          primary function without also exporting the global secondary function
          function. I then remembered that we had previously learned that
          functions could be defined within other functions. I therefore defined
          the second function used with the find() method <i>within</i>the
          primary function. I thought this was an elegant solution because the
          end result (i.e. the primary function) was entirely self-contained. It
          felt satisfying to solve this and reinforced what we had previously
          learned about different ways to define functions in Javascript.

                I feel less confident when simply trying something. I usually
                like to research beforehand and try to figure out what to do as
                my next step, rather than just trying for trying's sake; this
                can sometimes just feel like you're flailing around in the dark.
                However, I am confident in trying to imlpement new possible
                solutions once I have some idea of what I think may work. I am
                also less satisfied when copying and pasting somebody else's
                code that I don't understand. Understanding the working of the
                code that I'm using is important to me, although I recognise
                this isn't always feasible.

                I haven't needed to use this method yet, but I think I will be
                confident in using it once the need does arise. I think this
                will likely happen when we face more complicated problems later
                down the line.

                I'm confident at solving problems using error messages, although
                this can really depend on the quality of the error messages
                themselves. These can sometimes be very informative and helpful,
                but can also be very cryptic and unclear. However, I'm confident
                at researching what these cryptic messages mean. Some problems
                also occur without necessarily calling error messages, which is
                a further limitation.

                and to see when certain blocks of code are triggered. I used
                this technique to check my 'if' statements when solving the
                Fizzbuzz problem.

        <h3>Reflections on asking for help</h3>
        <p>
          I've been reluctant to ask for any help when I've faced problems while
          coding up until now because I have wanted to solve them on my own.
          I've been able to recognise that these are the kinds of problems that
          I have the tools to solve and to troubleshoot at this stage, because
          all the problems I've faced so far have not been too complex, and
          there is lots of information available in documentation. However, it
          is important to recognise situations where I do need to ask for help,
          and when these arise, I am usually happy to ask.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think that if I would need to ask for help, then the remotene nature
          of foundations would be the biggest barrier that I would need to
          overcome. I personally find it much easier to ask for help in-person
          rather than over the internet. I need to be aware of these barriers
          and be willing to overcome them as we will be doing a hybrid bootcamp.
          I understand that most help will be through one-on-one calls with
          facilitators via video chat, so hopefully this should make comms
          easier.
